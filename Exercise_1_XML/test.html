               Chapter 7<sup><u>th</u></sup>
            </h1>
<p>
               <sup>It was on a dreary</sup> night of November<br />
               that I beheld <s><sup>the frame on whic</sup></s> my man comple<s>at</s><sup>te</sup>ed<s>.</s><sup>,</sup> <s>And</s><br />
               with an anxiety that almost amount<br />
               ed to agony I collected instruments of life<br />
               around me <s>and endeavour to</s> <sup>that I might</sup> <s>e</s><sup>i</sup>nfuse a<br />
               spark of being into the lifeless thin<s>k</s><sup>g</sup><br />
               that lay at my feet. It was already<br />
               one in the morning, <s>the rain</s> pattered<br />
               dismally against the window panes, &amp;<br />
               my candle was nearly burnt out, when<br />
               by the glimmer of the half extinguish<br />
               ed light I saw the dull yellow eye of<br />
               the creature open<s>.</s><sup>â€”</sup>It breathed hard,<br />
               and a convulsive motion agitated<br />
               its limbs.
            </p>
<p>
               <s>But how</s> How can I describe my<br />
               emotion at this catastrophe; or how deli<br />
               neate the wretch whom with such<br />
               infinite pains and care I had endeavoured<br />
               to form. His limbs were in proportion<br />
               and I had selected his features <s>h</s> as<br />
               <s>handsome</s> <s><sup>handsome</sup></s> <sup>beautiful</sup>. <sup><s>Handsome</s></sup>; Great God! His<br />
               <s>dun</s> <sup>yellow</sup> skin scarcely covered the work of<br />
               muscles and arteries beneath; his hair<br />
               was <sup>of a lustrous black &amp;</sup> flowing and his teeth of a pearly white<br />
               ness but these luxurianc<sup>i</sup>es only <s>fomed</s><br />
               formed a more horrid contrast with
               his watry eyes that seemed almost of
               the same colour as the dun white
               sockets in which they were set,
            </p>

            BOOK I.
            A JUST MAN.
            
            CHAPTER I.
            M. MYRIEL.
            
            In 1815 M. Charles Francois Bienvenu Myriel
            was Bishop of D. He was a man of about
            seventy-five years of age, and had held the see of
            D since 1806. Although the following details
            in no way affect our narrative, it may not be useless
            to quote the rumors that were current about him
            at the moment when he came to the diocese, for
            what is said of men, whether it be true or false,
            often occupies as much space in their life, and especially
            in their destiny, as what they do. M. Myriel
            was the son of a councillor of the Aix Parliament.
            It was said that his father, who intended that he
            should be his successor, married him at the age of
            eighteen or twenty, according to a not uncommon
            custom in parliamentary families. Charles Myriel,
            in spite of this marriage (so people said), had been
            the cause of much tattle. He was well built, though
            of short stature, elegant, graceful, and witty ; and
            1

            the earlier part of his life was devoted to the world
            and to gallantry. The Revolution came, events hurried
            on, and the parliamentary families, decimated
            and hunted down, became dispersed. M. Charles
            Myriel emigrated to Italy in the early part of the
            Revolution, and his wife, who had been long suffering
            from a chest complaint, died there, leaving no
            children. What next took place in M. Myriel's destiny?
            Did the overthrow of the old French society,
            the fall of his own family, and the tragic spectacles
            of '93, more frightful perhaps to the emigres who saw
            them from a distance with the magnifying power of
            terror, cause ideas of renunciation and solitude to
            germinate in him ? Was he, in the midst of one of
            the distractions and affections which occupied his
            life, suddenly assailed by one of those mysterious
            and terrible blows which often prostrate, by striking
            at his heart, a man whom public catastrophes could
            not overthrow by attacking him in his existence and
            his fortune? No one could have answered these
            questions ; all that was known was that when he
            returned from Italy he was a priest.
            
            In 1804 M. Myriel was Curé of B (Brignolles).
            He was already aged, and lived in great
            retirement. Towards the period of the coronation
            a small matter connected width his curacy, no one
            remembers what, took him to Paris. Among other
            powerful persons he applied to Cardinal Fesch on
            behalf of his parishioners. One day, when the Emperor
            was paying a visit to his uncle, the worthy
            cure, who was waiting in the ante-room, saw his Majesty
            pass. Napoleon, noticing this old man regard

            him with some degree of curiosity, turned and aslced
            sharply, —
            " Who is this good man who is staring at me ?"
            " Sire," M. Myriel said, " you are looking at a
            good man and I at a great man. We may both
            profit by it."
            
            The Emperor, on the same evening, asked the
            Cardinal the cure's name, and some time after M.
            Myriel, to his great surprise, learned that he was
            nominated Bishop of D . What truth, by the
            way, was there in the stories about M. Myriel's
            early life ? No one knew, for few persons had been
            acquainted with his family before the Revolution.
            M. Myriel was fated to undergo the lot of every new
            comer to a little town, where there are many mouths
            that speak, and but few heads that think. He was
            obliged to undergo it, though he was bishop, and
            because he was bishop. But, after all, the stories
            in which his name was mingled were only stories,
            rumors, words, remarks, less than words, mere
            palabres, to use a term borrowed from the energetic
            language of the South. Whatever they might
            be, after ten years of episcopacy and residence at
            D , all this gossip, which at the outset affords
            matter of conversation for little towns and little
            people, had fallen into deep oblivion. No one would
            have dared to speak of it, no one have dared to
            remember it.
            
            M. Myriel had arrived at D , accompanied by
            an old maid. Mlle. Baptistine, who was his sister, and
            ten years younger than himself. Their only servant
            was a female of the same age as Mademoiselle, of the
            
            4 FANTINE.
            name of Madame Magloire, who, after having been
            the servant of M. le Curé, now assumed the double
            title of waiting-woman to Mademoiselle, and housekeeper
            to Monseigneur. Mlle. Baptistine was a tall,
            pale, slim, gentle person ; she realized the ideal of
            what the word " respectable " expresses, for it seems
            necessary for a woman to be a mother in order to be
            venerable. She had never been pretty, but her whole
            life, which had been but a succession of pious works,
            had eventually cast over her a species of whiteness
            and brightness, and in grooving older she had acquired
            what may be called the beauty of goodness.
            AVhat had been thinness in her youth had become in
            her maturity transparency, and through this transparency
            the angel could be seen. She seemed to
            be a shadow, there was hardly enough body for a
            sex to exist ; she was a little quantity of matter containing
            a light — an excuse for a soul to remain upon
            the earth. Madame Magloire was a fair, plump,
            busy little body, always short of breath, — in the
            first place, through her activity, and, secondly, in
            consequence of an asthma.
            
            On his arrival M. Myriel was installed in his episcopal
            palace with all the honors allotted by the imperial
            decrees which classify the Bishop immediately
            after a Major-General. The Mayor and the President
            paid him the first visit, and he on his side paid the
            first visit to the General and the Prefect. When the
            installation was ended the town waited to see its
            bishop at work. -->
